# Reolink-webserver
This Python script uses Flask to capture and serve images from a camera in real time. It authenticates with the camera, fetches images at intervals, crops them based on set dimensions, and displays the latest image on a web page that auto-refreshes. Configuration settings are managed through environment variables.
